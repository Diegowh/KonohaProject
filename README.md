## Project Objectives
Create a gamified time-management app inspired on the Naruto universe with a progression system and visual personalization.
- Add a progression system to unlock characters, evolve them, etc. through XP earned using the app.
- Customizable focus/break cycles.
- Include progress tracking and achievement stats.
- The progression system will never use any gacha mechanics.
